Squareone is the next-generation landing page for the Rubin Science Platform.
It's where you start on your journey to use the RSP's portal, notebooks, and APIs to do science with Rubin/LSST data.

Development
===========

First, run the development server::

   yarn dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the site.
This site auto-updates when running with the development server.

`API routes <https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction>`_ are accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello.
This endpoint can be edited in ``pages/api/hello.js``.
The ``pages/api`` directory is mapped to ``/api/*``.
Files in this directory are treated as `API routes`_ instead of React pages.
